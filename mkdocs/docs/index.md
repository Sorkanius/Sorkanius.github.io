# Hello!

Welcome to my Personal website.

![Me](img/IPR.jpg)

I am [Ignacio Peletier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignacio-peletier/) a Spanish Telecommunications engineer specialized in Data Science. Constantly learning, currently I am immersed in topics such as causal
inference and Bayesian statistics.

# Blog

Although I will cover diverse topics in my blog, you will mainly find: **statistical inference, causal inference, bayesian statistics and machine learning**.

1. **Valorant Aim**. Here you will find an analysis about accuracy with different guns while playing Valorant. 
2. **Valorant Aim: The Bayesian Way**. Using the same data as the previous post, we build a logistic regression the Bayesian way.

### Experience

I have experience in topics related with machine learning and statistics. I have worked from projects on image classification and object detection to optimize specific metrics using machine learning and measuring results with Causal Inference techniques, both in experimentation frameworks and with observational data.

Starting from hardware, I switched to the software world at my first job at Epic Labs. After working there with deep learning for a year, I decided to strengthen my knowledge by coming back to school and study a master's degree. I joined a research group in my last two years of my Bachelor's and during my master's.

Once I finished my master's degree I came back to Epic Labs, they had started their own product: Lightflow, which was then acquired by Haivision.

Currently, I work as a Senior Data Scientist at Cabify in the pricing squad.
