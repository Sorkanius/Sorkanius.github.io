# Hello!

Welcome to my Personal website.

![Me](img/IPR.jpg)

I am [Ignacio Peletier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignacio-peletier/) a Spanish Telecommunications engineer specialized in Data Science. I am very passionate about my work and I enjoy freelancing data-related projects in my spare time. Constantly learning, currently I am immersed in topics such as causal inference and Bayesian statistics.

# Blog

Although I will cover diverse topics in my blog, you will mainly find: **statistical inference, causal inference, bayesian statistics and machine learning**.

1. **Valorant Aim**. Here you will find an analysis about accuracy with different guns while playing Valorant. 
2. **Valorant Aim: The Bayesian Way**. Using the same data as the previous post, we build a logistic regression the Bayesian way.
