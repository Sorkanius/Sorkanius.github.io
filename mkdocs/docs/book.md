## ðŸ“˜ *En quÃ© piensan los robots* â€” An Artificial Intelligence Book for Everyone

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a theme from science fiction movies â€” it is shaping our everyday lives. From recommendation algorithms and delivery apps to medical robots and virtual assistants like ChatGPT, AI has become a **daily presence**. But with these innovations come urgent ethical questions:  

- How do we prevent algorithms from reinforcing bias and discrimination?  
- Who is accountable if an AI system makes a mistake in healthcare?  
- Should we trust the future of humanity to a small group of tech executives and investors?  

### Why This AI Book Matters
*En quÃ© piensan los robots* is written for **anyone who wants to understand artificial intelligence and machine learning** without needing a technical background. It explores both the opportunities and the challenges of AI, offering readers clear insights into:  

- The fundamentals of AI and machine learning  
- Real-world applications of algorithms in business and society  
- The ethical dilemmas and responsibilities of building and using AI  
- How each of us can take part in shaping a responsible AI future  

Instead of treating AI as something distant or overly technical, this book brings the debate closer to home. It provides the tools to understand how algorithms work, what they mean for our lives, and why **ethical AI is everyoneâ€™s responsibility**.
