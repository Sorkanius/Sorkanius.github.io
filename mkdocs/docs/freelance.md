# Freelance

In my spare time enjoy freelancing data-related tasks. Yes! That is how much I love data. Here are some examples of projects that I have worked on:

* Measure the effect of Covid on unenployment.
* Study the framework for an observational study on a Health App.
* Developed a Marketing Mix Model using Robyn.
* Consultancy on Experimentation for a mobile game.
* Creating the simulator for the numbers on a racing game.
* Assessing the effect of a drug on newborns.
